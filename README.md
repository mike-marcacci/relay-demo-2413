This demonstrates the issue described in https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/2413.

---

This is a template for creating demos with react and relay. Because our test GraphQL server is running in the browser, these demos can be hosted on github pages or any static host.

Use the command `yarn relay` to run the relay compiler.
Use the command `yarn start` to run a development server.
Use the command `yarn build` to build the static site to the `/build` directory.
Use the command `yarn deploy` to deploy the static site using github pages.

Before deploying, **make sure you change the `homepage` property in `package.json`**!!
